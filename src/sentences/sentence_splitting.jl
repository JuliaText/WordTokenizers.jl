"""
     postproc_splits(sentences)

Applies heuristic rules to repair sentence splitting errors.
Developed for use as postprocessing for the GENIA sentence
splitter on PubMed abstracts, with minor tweaks for
full-text documents.

`sentences` should be a string, with line breaks on sentence boundries.
Returns a similar string, but more correct.

Based on
https://github.com/ninjin/geniass/blob/master/geniass-postproc.pl
Which is
(c) 2010 Sampo Pyysalo. No rights reserved, i.e. do whatever you like with this.
Which draws in part on heuristics included in Yoshimasa Tsuruoka's
medss.pl script.
